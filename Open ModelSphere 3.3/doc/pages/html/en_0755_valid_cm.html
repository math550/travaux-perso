<b>Open ModelSphere</b> has more flexibility in class modeling than what the Java language permits.
To ensure that the generated code is Java conform, the application has a validation function. 
Use this powerful feature to monitor potential errors in your
Java code as you build your models. You can choose to validate a class, a group of
classes (package-level), or all the classes in a model (project-level). 
<br><br>
Follow these
easy steps:<ol>
<li>Highlight the class model<br><br></li>
<li>In the menu choose <b>Tools > Validate for Java</b><br><br></li>
<li>A report will appear indicating if and where the model is not valid. It is also
possible to save or print the report using the File menu.</li>
</ol><br>
