<b>Open ModelSphere</b> offers two types of flows: the right-angle and the free
angle flows. Both play exactly the same role; only their appearance is different.<ol>

<li>Select the <b>flow creation tool</b> located in the <b>Process modeling toolbar</b> ( <img src="../images/angulararrowfill.gif"> or <img src="../images/rightanglearrowfill.gif"> ).<br><br></li>
<li>Choose one of the flows displayed in the toolbar (you can regularly use
any of the associations, however, for the purpose of this example, choose
the right angle flow <img src="../images/rightanglearrowfill.gif">).<br><br></li>
<li>With the flow tool selected, click somewhere in the middle of the source
process, then, in the middle of the target process.<br><br></li>
</ol>The Properties window of the flow contains a menu that gives information regarding
the flows and linked objects.

<font face="sans serif,arial,helvetica" color="000000" size="4"><b>Properties</b></font><br><br>

The Design tab of the Properties window provides the following information:<ul>

<li>the <b>flow identifier</b>: which is automatically given when you create a new flow,
but can be modified directly in this window or by renumbering.<br><br></li>
<li>its <b>name</b><br><br></li>

<li>its <b>alias</b>, that you can use to display another name<br><br></li>
<li>its <b>physical name</b><br><br></li>

<li>the information or product <b>frequency</b> as it is carried by the flow<br><br></li>
<li>the <b>discrete</b> or <b>continuous</b> (represented by a double-arrow and could be
used, for example, to represent an electrical flow) property of the flow<br><br></li>
<li>an <b>emission condition</b>, (the condition for the flow of information or product)<br><br></li>



</ul>
<b>You can specify if it is a control flow (displayed with a dotted line on the graphic
window), for example a flow that represents a triggering event.</b>
<br><br>
<br>


<font face="sans serif,arial,helvetica" color="000000" size="4"><b>Changing discrete-continuous property</b></font><br><br>

The <b>Discrete</b> or <b>Continuous</b> option from the Flow Properties window lets you transform
the nature of one or more diagram flows. <b>Open ModelSphere</b> lets you
represent discrete flows as well as continuous flows. A discrete flow only has one
arrowhead at its extremity(ies) while a continuous flow features two arrowheads at
its extremity(ies).

<br><br><br>

<font face="sans serif,arial,helvetica" color="000000" size="4"><b>Changing Control Property</b></font><br><br>

The control flows do not transmit information between two objects. They specify that
an event occurred or they give a command. These flows are called event flows.<br><br>
When a process accepts and produces only event flows, it is called a control process.
An input event flow has an effect on the control process which produces, afterwards,
an output event flow. The input event flow indicates that the condition is satisfied
for the transaction to occur. This transaction provokes an action represented
by an output event flow.

<br><br>
As for the control store, it is used to keep the occurrences of a control flow.
In the diagram window, a control object has a dotted frame. To change the control
property of flows:
<ol>
<li><b>Right-click</b> on the object and choose <b>Properties</b>. It will open its properties
window.<br><br></li>
<li>Check the <b>Control</b> box.<br><br></li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> and <b>Close</b>.<br><br></li>

</ol>



For <b>processes</b>, <b>stores</b> and <b>external entities</b>, you can also change the control option
in their corresponding properties window.<br><br>
In <b>ModelSphere</b>, the control notion also applies to external entities and
to any notation.
