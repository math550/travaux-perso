The <b>Split</b> command has been implanted to facilitate team work. It offers
the possibility to split a model or a part of it. The result of the split operation
is another file without any link with the original.<br><br>
Before a split can be executed, the model must be opened and a process must be
graphically selected. This action will split the process and its descendants from the model.<br><br>
To split a process, choose <b>Tools > Split</b>. 
<br><br>
After the operation, a new project, Split project, is created and remains opened.
The previously selected process becomes the context diagram of this new model.
<br><br>
When a process has been split from a model, its instance in the original model is automatically set to 'external'.
Then an 'E' appears after its identifier.
