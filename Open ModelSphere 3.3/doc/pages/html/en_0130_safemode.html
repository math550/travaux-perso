Open ModelSphere has been designed to be a very stable application. 
For the unlikely case of external impacts on ModelSphere's stability, 
it offers the possibility to disable some features that can cause the application's malfunctioning, 
and then restart the application in a safer mode. 
<br><br>
To invoke this feature, choose <b>Help > Advanced > Restart in Safe Mode</b> in the <b>main menu</b>.  
You will have the opportunity to enable or disable five options that can cause instability:<ul> 

<li><b>Disable DirectDraw</b>: DirectDraw, a Sun component used by Swing graphics, can crash the JVM. 
It happens with some videos cards, such as ATI. DirectDraw can be disabled if you experience application problems. <br><br></li>

<li><b>Erase Preferences:</b> Because ModelSphere preferences are stored in properties (text) files, 
they could be accidently edited and preferences can be set to invalid values.
(For instance, setting the size of the ModelSphere main frame to a value higher of the size of the screen can make ModelSphere malfunctional.)  
Altered preferences can be erased and then reset to their default values. <br><br></li>

<li><b>Use Metal as Look and Feel</b>: Swing supports several look-and-feels, including plugable look-and-feels.  
If a particular look-and-feel causes ModelSphere malfunctioning, it is possible to restart ModelSphere by using the default look-and-feel, 
which is Metal. <br><br></li>

<li><b>Do not load any plug-in</b>: ModelSphere is an open product, and it is possible for everybody to add a user-defined plug-in. 
If such a plug-in is malfunctional, it may cause ModelSphere to crash. It is possible to restart ModelSphere and to refuse to 
load any plug-in. <br><br></li>

<li><b>Set Locale to English</b>: ModelSphere works either in English and in French locales by default, but the door is open to run ModelSphere in other languages.  
The English locale is the most used one; it is possible to force ModelSphere to restart using this default locale. <br><br></li>


</ul>
