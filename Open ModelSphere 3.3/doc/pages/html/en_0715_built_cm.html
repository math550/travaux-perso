You can create Java application components by reusing existing ones or by adding
new ones in a class model. In the latter case, the model can be created in two
different ways: (1) in the <b>explorer</b> window or (2) in the <b>diagram window</b>.<br><br>
First, you must right-click <b>project</b> and in the <b>pop-up menu</b> choose <b>Add > Add class
model</b>.

You can accept the default model name, Class model, or you can immediately assign
a more meaningful name to the model.
<br><br>
You can also create Java application components by reusing existing ones. For example
the <b>Copy/Paste</b> function can be used on compatible objects within or outside
the project. On the other hand, the <b>Move</b> function is applied on compatible objects
which are in the same project (on the object pop-up menu, choose <b>Move</b>).
