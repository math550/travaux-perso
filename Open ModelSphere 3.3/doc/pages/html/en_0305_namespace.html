A semantic object is a meaningful object used in the software engineering process.
Any semantic object is characterized by a set of common attributes: name, alias and
description. Note that the data model objects also have the physical name attribute.<br><br>
<b>Open ModelSphere</b> does not control name uniqueness so objects could have
identical names. Although it is not recommended, it is even possible to omit giving
a name to a semantic object.
